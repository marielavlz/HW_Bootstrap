				    			Hello! My name is Mariela Velez Natal, or Mariela Velez for short. People call me "Mari" or "Mary" for convenience since my name is difficult to pronounce in English. I was born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico and raised in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. When I was 12 years old, I moved from Puerto Rico to mainland United States where I attended high school at Tomball High School and then graduated from The University of Texas at Austin. I majored in Microbiology and Infectious Disease.
				    		</p>
				    		<p>
				    			Some of my favourite things to do is read comic books, write fictional short stories, collect Disney animated films, and play with all my little ones. I'm a pround auntie/titi of 3 babies and cousin of a toddler. They're the most important people in my life and I can talk about them for hours.
				    		</p>
				    		<p>
				    			Finally, some interesting things about me is that I'm fully bilingual, I worked in a bacteriology lab for a year and a half studying <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and loved it, and have identified a variety of pathogenic bacteria before in a clinical setting. I'm not as skilled handling and isolating viruses, but I'm a quick and dedicated learner, so perhaps one day in the future I'll return to that.
